## Installation tools on Ubuntu  

You already know which are the basic tools that every programmer must master:  

- The console / terminal / command line  
- The code editor: Visual Studio Code  
- The programming language: Python  

In this reading I will teach you how to install each of them on a computer with Ubuntu as the operating system. If you have another Linux distribution, the steps will most likely vary slightly. But also, it is equally likely that you already know how to do all this without this tutorial, because as a Linux user you generally have a more advanced knowledge of how the operating system works. Without further ado, let's start with the console:  

**Console Installation**  

Surprise! In Ubuntu you don't need to install a console unlike Windows. To be able to use the terminal you must press Ctrl + Alt + t and voil√†, it will open in front of your eyes  

Let's move on to installing the code editor. In this course we are going to work with **Visual Studio Code**, so let's get it ready:  

**Code editor installation**  

1. Open your preferred browser (Firefox, Chrome, whatever you want) and go to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=760868  

2. Open the downloaded file. You will notice that it ends in ".deb"  

3. Follow the installation steps  

- Enter your system password  

- Wait for the installation finish  

4. Open your editor, and voila!, working üòâ  

Excellent, we only have to install Python:  

**Python installation**  

The programming language is the jewel in the crown of our tools. Without Python you can't program, it's that simple. Follow the next steps:  

1. Open your terminal and run the following commands:  

```
sudo apt update
```

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

It will show you if you want to continue with the installation, click on enter  

The installation will start  

2. Run the python3 -V command to verify that the programming language was installed correctly  

If the result looks like the one you can see in the screenshot, it means that everything went well and we can continue üí™üèº  

You already have all three tools running on your computer. Join me to the next class to learn how to use the terminal üíª

By the way, in Linux Ubuntu like Linux Mint all above works too
