## Installation tools on Mac

You already know which are the basic tools that every programmer must master:  

- The console / terminal / command line
- The code editor: Visual Studio Code
- The programming language: Python

In this reading, I'll show you how to install each of them on a Mac. Let's start with the console:

**Console installation**  

Surprise! On Mac you don't need to install a console unlike Windows. However, to be able to use the terminal correctly you must follow a series of steps:  

1. Open the ***Applications*** folder. Then, go to ***Utilities*** and double click on the **Terminal** application. This should open up the command console for you. If it didn't work for you or you couldn't find the **Terminal** app, you can press *‚åò + space bar* to open Spotlight. There write "Terminal" and click on the first search result

2. Run the following commands:
```
sudo xcode-select --install
sudo xcode-select --reset
```

Terminal will ask you to enter your computer's administrator password. Do it  

Once you complete the two steps above, your terminal should work perfectly. Let's move on to installing the code editor. In this course we're going to work with Visual Studio Code, so let's get it ready:

**Code editor installation**  

1. Open your preferred browser (Safari, Chrome, whichever you want) and go to https://code.visualstudio.com/  

2. Once there, click on the "Download for Mac" or "Download for Mac" button  

3. Open the list of downloaded files in your browser, and find the installer  

4. Drag the **Visual Studio Code.app** file to the *Applications* folder

5. Add the editor to the *dock* by right clicking on the icon that appears on the screen and selecting ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù or ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù, and then ‚ÄúKeep in dock‚Äù or ‚ÄúKeep in dock‚Äù  

6. Open your editor, and voila!, working üòâ  

Excellent, we only have to install Python:

**Python installation**  

The programming language is the jewel in the crown of our tools. Without Python you can't program, it's that simple. Follow the next steps:  

1. Open your preferred browser (Safari, Chrome, whichever you want) and go to https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Click on the "Download Python 3.x.x" button. In the "x" you will see numbers. The important thing is that the first number is a 3, the two that follow do not interest us, because they change all the time  

3. Open the downloaded installer, and follow the steps  

Perfect! You already have the three tools running on your Mac. Come with me to the next class to learn how to use the terminal üíª
