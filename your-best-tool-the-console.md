## Your best tool: the console

We don't necessarily need the graphical interface of our console to be able to handle it. We don't need the file explorer, with the console we can interact with our team through special commands that we are going to write. Among the commands that we will use the most we've:  

````
Ctrl + L -> allows us to clean the screen of our console
cd       -> is the abbreviation of change directory, this allows us to put the name of a folder, enter that folder
cd ..    -> allows us to return to the parent folder
ls       -> means list and allows us to view the files we have inside a folder
mkdir    -> means make directory and allows us to create a new folder. If we give a space we can put the name we want the mkdir folder to have
touch    -> allows us to create a file. As in the previous command, we can add the name of the file and its extension type touch example.txt with a space
