## Basics

### Programming

In technology there are many programming languages and the most common question that we usually ask ourselves when starting is what language should we learn first? The best thing is to change the focus and ask ourselves, what do we want to achieve with that programming language? With this we will stop seeing the languages and instead we will see the specialties that the field of technology has  

### What fields exist within technology?  

- **Frontend**: It's the field that is responsible for bringing the design of an application or website to reality  
- **Backend**: It's the field in which the Logic by which an application works is created and that logic lives inside a server  
- **IoT**(Internet of Things): It's the field that is responsible for giving the ability to connect to the internet to objects that we see around us such as appliances and robots  
- **AI** (Artificial intelligence): Focuses on teaching a computer to solve a problem without us doing it on our own  
- **DevOps**: They're the people who're in charge of managing the server and the cloud. It's responsible for controlling the entire infrastructure through which an application works  
- **Data Science**: It's responsible for taking information that we've in the environment and acquiring relevant information from that  
- **Video game development**: It's about combining art, soundtrack and programming in a product that gives a pleasant user experience  
- **Mobile development**: It's the field in which applications are created so that in their future they live in the Play Store and the App Store and that we can download and carry them on our phones  

#### In what fields is Python present?  

- **IoT**
- **AI**
- **Backend**
- **Data Science**

The most famous companies that use Python are:  
- Instagram
- Google
- Spotify
- Netflix
- Uber

What are the advantages of using Python?  

1. It helps us to strengthen good practices  
2. It is easy to learn, it is in good contact with the English language  
3. It is an elegant language that needs a defined structure to function properly  

### Why learn Python?

Python is an interpreted programming language whose philosophy emphasizes the readability of its code. It's a multiparadigm programming language, since it partially supports object orientation, imperative programming and, to a lesser extent, functional programming. It is an interpreted, dynamic and multiplatform language  

### The core of a program: algorithms

In Mathematics, Logic, Computer Science, and related disciplines, an algorithm is a set of defined and unambiguous, ordered and finite instructions or rules that typically allows solving a problem, performing a computation, processing data, and carrying out other tasks or activities  

The algorithms have some special characteristics:  

1. To build an algorithm that works we cannot have infinite steps, we must have a clear beginning and end to define the series of steps that take us from the beginning to the end. Therefore, the algorithms **are finite**, that's they've a defined number of steps  
2. Algorithms **cannot be ambiguous**, that's all steps have to be well defined and work in all contexts  

Within programming, these algorithms are usually represented graphically by means of **flow diagrams**. This is the graphical way of showing the algorithms that we're going to do
